 * Tells whether the current branch has fallen behind `origin/dev`, the branch

 *
 *   npm run branch:check              exit 1 when behind, with the fix
 *   node scripts/branch-check.mjs --warn   print only when behind, always exit 0
 *
 * `--warn` is the SessionStart hook: silence costs no context, and a failed
 * fetch (offline, no remote) must never block a session.
