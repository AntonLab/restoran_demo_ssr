/**
 * Links every skill in skills-lock.json into .claude/skills/, the directory
 * Claude Code reads project skills from. `npm run skills` runs it right after
 * `skills experimental_install`.
 *
 * That restore writes .agents/skills/ only: it installs for the CLI's
 * "universal" agents, and Claude Code, whose directory is .claude/skills/, is
 * not one of them. Without this step a fresh clone would give Claude Code
 * none of the locked skills.
 *
 * Each link is a junction on Windows, which needs neither admin rights nor
 * Developer Mode, and a symlink elsewhere. Running it twice changes nothing.
 * A link is removed only when it points into .agents/skills/ and names no
 * locked skill, so a skill written straight into .claude/skills/ is left
 * alone.
